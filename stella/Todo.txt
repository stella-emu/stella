                         To Do List - November 2008
===============================================================================

If you would like to contribute to Stella's development then find something
on the list below and send email to Bradford Mott at bwmott@acm.org or
Stephen Anthony at stephena@users.sourceforge.net.

  * New UI subsystem where drawing is done into separate buffers, not
    directly into the TIA window

  * Make UI 'font-sensitive' and remove all hardcoded dimensions for
    widget/font sizes

  * Add option to automatically save snapshots in 1X mode (useful for
    RomInfoWidget)

  * Add infrastructure to show all info gathered from a ROM (similar to what
    is currently displayed on the commandline).  Add a UI part for this, so
    users aren't forced to use the commandline to see it.

  * Research starting bank for 8K/F8 ROMs.  Probably default should be 0
    instead of 1.

  * Add commandline argument to randomly generate startup bank for all ROMs
    bigger than 4K.  Shouldn't make a difference for all 'well-designed' ROMS,
    but will pick up on errors when a ROM doesn't start from every bank.

  * A way to override (possibly temporarily) all properties for a ROM, and
    use global ones instead.  Tied to the current developer commandline
    options, but presented in a GUI.

  * More work to the ROM launcher, including at least the following:
     (1) Only show files with certain extensions (including a UI part to
         edit this).

     (2) Shortcut key where selecting the first few letters jumps to a
         directory named that way.  Basically the same as is currently
         done for ROMs.

     (3) Have time between keypresses be configurable when jumping to files.

     (4) Reload current listing (possibly tied to a RMB context menu).

     (5) Add commandline argument to toggle launcher use.

  * Research lockups in Stay Frosty ROM.  Test out sample state file in
    AtariAge email.

  * More support for copy and paste.

  * Fix PropSet to properly delete entries when 'Default' is pressed in
    the GameInfoDialog; perhaps move to C++ maps instead of the current
    home-made BST code.

  * 'Fixed Debug Colours' option as explained in the 'Stella 2.6.1 released'
    thread, post #40 on AtariAge.  Basically emulates no$2k6 behaviour.

  * Extra controllers (KidVid, Lightgun)

  * Fix "Tron Man Picture Cart" (32K Tigervision bankswitching) issue

  * Add new TIA infrastructure with improved HMOVE emulation

  * Possible 'trace mode' in debugger (generate a file containing all
    internal state)

  * Automatic statesave at beginning of each frame (including state of
    controllers and console switches), with the ability to 'roll back' to
    a previous state/frame

  * RewindManager to set up how often to save a state, and for how long
    (debugger would be once per frame, normal probably once per second)

  * Improve debugger support for cartridges with dedicated RAM, and add
    source-level debugging

  * Step-debug through disassembled zero-page code (get clarification on this)

  * Extra SECAM 'quirks' (see Stella 2.4.1 release thread on AtariAge)

  * Improve speed of Pitfall2 emulation

  * Improve sound output of Pitfall2

  * Add auto-detection for all remaining bankswitch types

  * Add support for uncommon controllers (KidVid, Lightgun, etc)

  * Either Support DASM as frontend or integrate a 6507 Assembler

  * Either Support Distella as frontend or integrate a 6507 Disassembler

  * Add a Sprite/Animation Editor 

  * AVI/MPEG export

  * Add a PF Editor

  * Client/Server networked play for up to 4 Computers via LAN/Internet

  * Tracking Hiscores

  * Find people to handle new ports, and try to more actively recruit people
    into the Stella project
