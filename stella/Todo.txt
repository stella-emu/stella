                         To Do List - November 2008
===============================================================================

If you would like to contribute to Stella's development then find something
on the list below and send email to Bradford Mott at bwmott@acm.org or
Stephen Anthony at stephena@users.sourceforge.net.

X * New UI subsystem where drawing is done into separate buffers, not
    directly into the TIA window

X * Make UI 'font-sensitive' and remove all hardcoded dimensions for
    widget/font sizes

X * Add option to automatically save snapshots in 1X mode (useful for
    RomInfoWidget)

X * A way to override (possibly temporarily) all properties for a ROM, and
    use global ones instead.  Tied to the current developer commandline
    options, but presented in a GUI (started from ROM launcher).

X * Add infrastructure to show all info gathered from a ROM (similar to what
    is currently displayed on the commandline).  Add a UI part for this, so
    users aren't forced to use the commandline to see it.

X * Fix issue with paddle support in Activision Casino ROM.

  * More work to the ROM launcher, including at least the following:
X    (1) Only show files with certain extensions (including a UI part to
         edit this).

     (2) Shortcut key where selecting the first few letters jumps to a
         directory named that way.  Basically the same as is currently
         done for ROMs.

X    (3) Have time between keypresses be configurable when jumping to files.

X    (4) Reload current listing (possibly tied to a RMB context menu).

  * Add new TIA infrastructure with improved HMOVE emulation

  * 'Fixed Debug Colours' option as explained in the 'Stella 2.6.1 released'
    thread, post #40 on AtariAge.  Basically emulates no$2k6 behaviour.

  * Research lockups in Stay Frosty ROM.  Test out sample state file in
    AtariAge email.

  * Research starting bank for 8K/F8 ROMs.  Probably default should be 0
    instead of 1.

  * Add commandline argument to randomly generate startup bank for all ROMs
    bigger than 4K.  Shouldn't make a difference for all 'well-designed' ROMS,
    but will pick up on errors when a ROM doesn't start from every bank.

  * More support for copy and paste.

  * Fix PropSet to properly delete entries when 'Default' is pressed in
    the GameInfoDialog; perhaps move to C++ maps instead of the current
    home-made BST code.

  * Fix Props.cxx (or GameInfoDialog) to properly deal with quotes and
    backslashes in strings meant to be saved to the properties file.

  * Extra controllers (KidVid, Lightgun)

  * Fix "Tron Man Picture Cart" (32K Tigervision bankswitching) issue

  * Possible 'trace mode' in debugger (generate a file containing all
    internal state)

  * Automatic statesave at beginning of each frame (including state of
    controllers and console switches), with the ability to 'roll back' to
    a previous state/frame

  * RewindManager to set up how often to save a state, and for how long
    (debugger would be once per frame, normal probably once per second)

  * Improve debugger support for cartridges with dedicated RAM, and add
    source-level debugging

  * Step-debug through disassembled zero-page code (get clarification on this)

  * Extra SECAM 'quirks' (see Stella 2.4.1 release thread on AtariAge)

  * Improve speed of Pitfall2 emulation

  * Improve sound output of Pitfall2

  * Add auto-detection for all remaining bankswitch types

  * Add support for uncommon controllers (KidVid, Lightgun, etc)

  * Either Support DASM as frontend or integrate a 6507 Assembler

  * Either Support Distella as frontend or integrate a 6507 Disassembler

  * Add a Sprite/Animation Editor 

  * AVI/MPEG export

  * Add a PF Editor

  * Client/Server networked play for up to 4 Computers via LAN/Internet

  * Tracking Hiscores

  * Find people to handle new ports, and try to more actively recruit people
    into the Stella project
