                         To Do List - February 19, 2005
===============================================================================

If you would like to contribute to Stella's development then find something
on the list below and send email to Bradford Mott at bwmott@acm.org or
Stephen Anthony at stephena@users.sourceforge.net.

For all ports (in order of importance):

  * Provide a fully integrated GUI where all settings can be changed, multiple
    games can be run, etc; basically, move all functionality of external
    frontends into Stella itself

  * Add an internal debugger to Stella for game developers

  * Provide suggestions for improving Stella

  * Provide suggestions for improving the Stella User's Manual

  * Find people to actually do the above ports, and try to more actively
    recruit people into the Stella project


For the various frontends

  - Discontinue all external frontends; integrate into Stella itself
  - Add a Sprite/Animation Editor 
  - Add a PF Editor
  - Add a Sourcecode Editor
  - Either Support DASM as frontend or integrate a 6507 Assembler
  - Either Support Distella as frontend or integrate a 6507 Disassembler
  - AVI/MPEG export
  - WAV/MP3 export
  - Client/Server networked play for up to 4 Computers via LAN/Internet
  - Tracking Hiscores
  - Record and Playback games - not as real movie, but by logging
    Input/RAM/processor states in given intervals.
  - Cheatcodes
  - Improve frontend by adding snapshots, labels, manuals, etc.
    Like KStella for Linux. (Suggestion from Brian Luttrull)
