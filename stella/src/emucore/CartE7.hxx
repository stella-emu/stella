/**
  This is the cartridge class for M-Network bankswitched games.  
  In this bankswitching scheme the 2600's 4K cartridge address 
  space is broken into two 2K segments.

  Kevin Horton describes E7 as follows:

    Only M-Network used this scheme. This has to be the 
    most complex method used in any cart! :-)  It allows 
    for the capability of 2K of RAM; although it doesn't 
    have to be used (in fact, only one cart used it).  
    There are now 8 2K banks, instead of 4.  The last 2K 
    in the cart always points to the last 2K of the ROM 
    image, while the first 2K is selectable.  You access 
    1FE0 to 1FE6 to select which 2K bank. Note that you
    cannot select the last 2K of the ROM image into the 
    lower 2K of the cart!  Accessing 1FE7 selects 1K of 
    RAM at 1000-17FF instead of ROM!  The 2K of RAM is
    broken up into two 1K sections.  One 1K section is 
    mapped in at 1000-17FF if 1FE7 has been accessed.  
    1000-13FF is the write port, while 1400-17FF is the 
    read port.  The second 1K of RAM appears at 1800-19FF.  
    1800-18FF is the write port while 1900-19FF is the 
    read port.  You select which 256 byte block appears 
    here by accessing 1FF8 to 1FFB.
