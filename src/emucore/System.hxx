/**
  This class represents a system consisting of a 6502 microprocessor
  and a set of devices.  The devices are mapped into an addressing
  space of 2^n bytes (1 <= n <= 16).  The addressing space is broken
  into 2^m byte pages (1 <= m <= n), where a page is the smallest unit
  a device can use when installing itself in the system.

  In general the addressing space will be 8192 (2^13) bytes for a
  6507 based system and 65536 (2^16) bytes for a 6502 based system.
