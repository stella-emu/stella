/*
 * This class is the core of stella's scheduling. Scheduling is a two step process
 * that is shared between the main loop in OSystem and this class.
 *
 * In emulation mode (as opposed to debugger, menu, etc.), each iteration of the main loop
 * instructs the emulation worker to start emulation on a separate thread and then proceeds
 * to render the last frame produced by the TIA (if any). After the frame has been rendered,
 * the worker is stopped, and the main thread sleeps until the time allotted to the emulation
 * timeslice (as calculated from the 6507 cycles that have passed) has been reached. After
 * that, it iterates.
 *
 * The emulation worker does its own microscheduling. After emulating a timeslice, it sleeps
 * until either the allotted time is up or it has been signalled to stop. If the time is up
 * without being signalled, the worker will emulate another timeslice, etc.
 *
 * In combination, the scheduling in the main loop and the microscheduling in the worker
 * ensure that the emulation continues to run even if rendering blocks, ensuring the real
 * time scheduling required for cycle exact audio to work.
