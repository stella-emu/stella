/**
  This is an extended version of the CBS RAM Plus bankswitching scheme
  supported by the Harmony cartridge.

  There are six (or seven) 4K banks, accessible by read/write to $1FF5 -
  $1FFA (or $1FFB), and 256 bytes of RAM.

  The 256 bytes of RAM can be loaded/saved to Harmony cart flash by
  accessing $1FF4 (see ramReadWrite() for more information), which is
  emulated by storing in a file.
  RAM read port is $1100 - $11FF, write port is $1000 - $10FF.

  For 29K versions of the scheme, the first 1K is ARM code (implements
  actual bankswitching on the Harmony cart), which is completely ignored
  by the emulator.  Also supported is a 32K variant.  In any event, only
  data at 1K - 29K of the ROM is used.
