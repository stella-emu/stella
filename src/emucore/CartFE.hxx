/**
  Bankswitching method used by Activision e.g. for Robot Tank and Decathlon
  Originally named SCABS (Subroutine Controlled Automatic Bank Switching)

  This scheme was originally designed to have up to 8 4K banks, and is
  triggered by monitoring the address bus for address $01FE. However, all
  released carts had only two banks.

  The following is paraphrased from the original patent by David Crane,
  European Patent Application # 84300730.3, dated 06.02.84:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The twelve line address bus is connected to a plurality of 4K by eight bit
  memories.

  The eight line data bus is connected to each of the banks of memory, also.
  An address comparator is connected to the bus for detecting the presence of
  the 01FE address.  Actually, the comparator will detect only the lowest 12
  bits of 1FE, because of the twelve bit limitation of the address bus.  Upon
  detection of the 01FE address, a one cycle delay is activated which then
  actuates latch connected to the data bus.  The three most significant bits
  on the data bus are latched and provide the address bits A13, A14, and A15
  which are then applied to a 3 to 8 de-multiplexer.  The 3 bits A13-A15
  define a code for selecting one of the eight banks of memory which is used
  to enable one of the banks of memory by applying a control signal to the
  enable, EN, terminal thereof.  Accordingly, memory bank selection is
  accomplished from address codes on the data bus following a particular
  program instruction, such as a jump to subroutine.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Note that in the general scheme, we use D7, D6 and D5 for the bank number
  (3 bits, so 8 possible banks), translated as follows:

    binary 111 -> decimal 7 -> 1st 4K ROM (bank 0) @ $F000 - $FFFF
    binary 110 -> decimal 6 -> 2nd 4K ROM (bank 1) @ $D000 - $DFFF
    binary 101 -> decimal 5 -> 3rd 4K ROM (bank 2) @ $B000 - $BFFF
    ...

  NOTE: Consult the patent application for more specific information, in
        particular *why* the address $01FE will be placed on the address
        bus after both the JSR and RTS opcodes.
