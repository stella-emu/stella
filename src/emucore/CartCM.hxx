  FIXME: This scheme is not yet fully implemented.  In particular, loading
         from and saving to the cassette is completely missing.

  Cartridge class used for SpectraVideo CompuMate bankswitched games.

  This is more than just a cartridge mapper - it's also a "computer" add-on.
  There's two 8K EPROMs soldered on top of each other.  There's two short
  wires with DB-9's on them which you plug into the two controller ports.
  A 42 or so key membrane keyboard with audio in and audio out, and 2K of RAM.

  There are 4 4K banks selectable at $1000 - $1FFF, and 2K RAM at
  $1800 - $1FFF (R/W 'line' is available at SWCHA D5, so there's no separate
  read and write ports).

  Bankswitching is done though the controller ports
    SWCHA: D7 = Audio input from tape player
           D6 = Audio out to tape player and 4017 CLK
                1 -> increase key column (0 to 9)
           D5 = 4017 RST, and RAM direction. (high = write, low = read)
                if D4 = 1:
                   0 -> enable key column CLK via D6
                   1 -> reset key column to 0 (CLK via D6 disabled)
                if D4 = 0:
                   0 -> enable RAM writing
                   1 -> enable RAM read
           D4 = RAM enable: 1 = disable RAM, 0 = enable RAM
           D3 = keyboard row 3 input (0 = key pressed)
           D2 = keyboard row 1 input (0 = key pressed)
           D1 = bank select high bit
           D0 = bank select low bit

    INPT0: D7 = FUNC key input (0 on startup / 1 = key pressed)
    INPT1: D7 = always HIGH input (pulled high thru 20K resistor)
    INPT2: D7 = always HIGH input (pulled high thru 20K resistor)
    INPT3: D7 = SHIFT key input (0 on startup / 1 = key pressed)
    INPT4: D7 = keyboard row 0 input (0 = key pressed)
    INPT5: D7 = keyboard row 2 input (0 = key pressed)

  The keyboard's composed of a 4017 1 of 10 counter, driving the 10 columns of
  the keyboard.  It has 4 rows.  The 4 row outputs are buffered by inverters.

  Bit 5 of portA controls the reset line on the 4017.  Pulling it high will reset
  scanning to column 0.  Pulling it low will allow the counter to be clocked.

  Bit 6 of portA clocks the 4017.  Each rising edge advances the column one
  count.

  There's 10 columns labelled 0-9, and 4 rows, labelled 0-3.

                           Column

  Function and Shift are separate keys that are read by 2 of the paddle inputs.
  These two buttons pull the specific paddle input low when pressed.

  Because the inputs are inverted, a low indicates a pressed button, and a high
  is an unpressed one.

  The audio input/output are designed to drive a tape player.  The audio output is
  buffered through an inverter and 2 resistors and a capacitor to reduce the level
  to feed it into the tape player.

  The audio input is passed through a .1uf capacitor and is pulled to 1/2 supply
  by two 20K resistors, then it goes through a hex inverting schmitt trigger to
  square it up.  This then runs into bit 7 of portA.

  This code was heavily borrowed from z26.
