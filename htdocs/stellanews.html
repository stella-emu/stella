The Stella repository has now been fully converted to Subversion.  All
developers currently using CVS should switch over to SVN immediately.


<H4>May 1, 2009</H4>
Stella release 2.7.7 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
<ul>
<li>Corrected emulation of CPU opcodes involving 'decimal' mode (ADC/RRA
    and SBC/ISB).  Special thanks to SeaGtGruff and others on the Stella
    mailing list for in-depth discussion and creation of test ROMs.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in F4SC bankswitching mode; writes to bankswitch addresses
    weren't triggering a bank switch.</li>

<li>Changed internal sound frequency of Pitfall 2 from 15.75KHz to 20KHz,
    as this sounds much more authentic when compared to a real cartridge.</li>
</ul>

Have Fun!


<H4>April 14, 2009</H4>
Stella release 2.7.6 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
<ul>
<li>Added support for 'EF' bankswitching (Paul Slocum Homestar Runner),
    as well as auto-detection of this format.</li>

<li>Added support for 'EFSC' bankswitching, as well as auto-detection of
    this format.  This is similar to the 'EF' scheme, but also includes
    128 bytes SuperChip RAM.</li>

<li>Added autodetection for '0840' and 'SB' bankswitching formats.</li>

<li>Improved autodetection for 'UA' bankswitching format.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in selecting video modes larger than the current screen;
    the resulting video mode will now be the largest one available
    (previously it selected the smallest one available).</li>

<li>The currently selected CPU register now displays its value in
    decimal and binary (in addition to hex) in the debugger.</li>
</ul>


<H4>March 27, 2009</H4>
Stella release 2.7.5 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
<ul>
<li>After about 2 years, finally fixed the infamous 'red screen' issue when
    using ATI video cards in OpenGL mode in Windows.  In the end, it was
    determined to be a bug in the ATI drivers.  Special thanks go to
    Ant (<a href="http://aqfl.net">http://aqfl.net</a>) for bugtesting and
    constant feedback wrt this bug.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in TIA SCORE mode emulation when the Priority bit is also
    set.  This fixes a very noticable graphical glitch in 'Swordquest
    Waterworld', as well as minor glitches in several other ROMs such
    as 'Space Shuttle'.</li>

<li>Treat spaces as normal characters in the ROM launcher.  This means
    that ROMs with spaces can be located with quick selection (ie,
    typing characters will automatically jump to a ROM with that name,
    and typing 'space' won't cause the launcher to jump back to the top
    of the list).</li>

<li>The debugger window can now have a minimum height of 620 lines
    (previously the minimum was 690), but you lose access to the TIA 'RAM'
    bytes when using this resolution.  This should allow it to work
    better on devices with small displays.</li>
</ul>


<H4>February 9, 2009</H4>
Stella release 2.7.3a for Windows is now available.
<ul>
<li>Fixed minor issue in 2.7.3 with basedir.txt functionality; the
    pathnames can now contain spaces.</li>
</ul>


<H4>February 9, 2009</H4>
Stella release 2.7.3 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
<ul>
<li>Fixed rendering issues in software mode when using 24-bit colour depth.
    This isn't as fast as 16 or 32-bit modes, so you're recommended to use
    one of those whenever possible.</li>

<li>For the Win32 port: re-added ability to change the default location
    for storing Stella config files.  To use this, simply create a file
    named 'basedir.txt' in the application directory containing the full
    path where all Stella-related items should be stored.</li>

<li>Tweaked the TIA info statistics overlay to be smaller while still
    including all relevant information.</li>
</ul>


<H4>January 27, 2009</H4>
Stella release 2.7.2 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
<ul>
<li>Fixed major bug in ROM Audit functionality; renaming ROMs would create
files without an extension.</li>
</ul>


<H4>January 26, 2009</H4>
Stella release 2.7.1 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
<ul>
<li>Partial workaround for sound not working in OpenGL video mode in
    Windows with ATI video hardware.  Sound will now work for the first ROM
    selected, but not for subsequent ones (you will have to quit and
    restart Stella for sound to work again).  Related to this, added
    '-audiofirst' commandline argument, which initializes audio before video
    when emulating a ROM.  Further work is required to completely fix
    this bug.</li>

<li>Fixed bug where volume wasn't being saved in 'Audio Settings' when
    started from the ROM launcher.</li>

<li>Fixed crash which sometimes occurred when viewing snapshots in the
    ROM Info viewer.</li>

<li>Allow setting window sizes for the ROM launcher and debugger to be larger
    than your desktop resolution.  Be careful with this feature, as switching
    to fullscreen mode may cause problems in such cases.</li>

<li>Made the ROM launcher filename filtering be case-insensitive.  This fixes
    a bug whereby ROMs with uppercase extensions were marked as invalid.</li>

<li>Added a pattern matching textbox to the ROM launcher, used to
    further filter the files shown in the listing.  For now, this filters
    files only (directories are not filtered, and are always shown).</li>

<li>The location of EEPROM files used for AtariVox/Savekey emulation can
    now be changed with the '-eepromdir' commandline argument as well as
    in the UI.</li>

<li>Added '-gl_aspectn' and '-gl_aspectp' commandline arguments (and
    associated UI items), which replace the previous '-gl_aspect' setting.
    The aspect modes can now be set separately for NTSC and PAL mode.
    Related to this, the range of values is now 80 - 120.</li>

<li>Fixed bug with hold-select/reset/button0 when overriding ROM properties;
    the checkboxes in the UI weren't actually doing anything.</li>

<li>The 'grabmouse' option is now configurable from the UI; previously
    it was only accessible from the commandline or its shortcut key.</li>

<li>Removed 'Emulation_HmoveBlanks' ROM property and associated UI item.
    You can no longer optionally turn off HMOVE blanking; it is always
    enabled when necessary.</li>
</ul>


<H4>January 19, 2009</H4>
Stella release 2.7 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
	<ul>
<li>Totally reworked the built-in UI to be font-sensitive and use higher-resolution
    fonts.  Stella now requires a minimum screen size of 640x480.
    If used in a resolution smaller than that, the fonts will be reduced
    accordingly.  Related to this, switching between software and OpenGL
    rendering now requires an application restart.</li>

<li>Added three different sized fonts (small, medium, large) which can be
    used in the ROM launcher.</li>

<li>Added ability to temporarily override ROM properties from the UI.  This
    is tied to a right mouse button context menu in the ROM launcher, and
    is very useful when you want to use a set of properties for all
    subsequent ROMs without having to manually change each one.</li>

<li>Added ability to filter the files shown in the ROM launcher.  Currently,
    the choices are 'all files', 'all roms', or 'roms ending with a certain
    extension'.  This functionality is tied to a right mouse button context
    menu in the ROM launcher.  Extensions can also be set with the
    '-launcherexts' commandline argument.</li>

<li>Added ability to reload the listing in the ROM launcher, either from
    a right mouse button context menu or pressing the Control/Cmd-R key.</li>

<li>Made the ROM info viewer in the ROM launcher configurable to show
    snapshots in 1x or 2x mode.</li>

<li>Made the delay between consecutive keys being recognized as one word
    configurable in the ROM launcher.  This is useful if you find that you
    have to press keys too quickly to jump to a specific ROM.  This can be
    set in the UI or using the '-listdelay' commandline argument.</li>

<li>Updated internal ROM properties database to ROM-Hunter version 4
    (thanks go to RomHunter for his tireless research in this area).</li>

<li>Expanded the statistics overlay for the TIA image to also show
    Display Format and Bankswitch type information.</li>

<li>Added '-ss1x' commandline argument and associated UI item, used to
    generate snapshots in 1x mode, independent of the filtering/scaling
    currently in use.</li>

<li>Various path textboxes in the UI now recognize './' (or '.\') to mean
    the current directory and '~/' (or '~\') to mean your home directory
    (for Windows, home directory will be your 'My Documents' folder).</li>

<li>Large speedup in loading directories with many files in the ROM launcher.</li>

<li>Fixed reset issue in 3E, 4A50, AR, CV, E7, F4SC, F6SC, F8SC, FASC and MC
    ROMs; the internal RAM wasn't being randomized after the initial reset.</li>

<li>M6532/RIOT RAM is now randomized at every reset, not just when the
    emulation starts.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in _diff pseudo-registers in the debugger; they were actually
    defined backwards.</li>

<li>Added fix for 'Challenge/Surfers Delight' ROM; the startup bank was
    incorrect.  Combined with the new 'Override Properties' functionality,
    you can now play both games directly from the UI (no need to use the
    commandline).</li>

<li>Fixed paddle issue with Activision Casino ROM; the last card in game 4
    can now be reached.</li>

<li>Added new pseudo-registers to the debugger, useful for conditional
    breakpoints (_fcount, _cclocks, _vsync, _vblank).</li>

<li>Added 'timing' commandline argument functionality to the UI, so you no
    longer need to use the commandline to set it.</li>

<li>Size restrictions on the TIA image are now strictly enforced.  The
    maximum height of a 1x TIA image is now 256 lines.</li>

<li>Added a new setting to the 'fullres' option named 'auto'.  Using
    'auto' will let Stella decide the best videomode to use in fullscreen.</li>

<li>Changed 'gl_fsmax' option to mean 'scale TIA image in fullscreen'.  It
    will have no effect on UI modes.</li>

<li>Changed 'gl_aspect' option to range 80-100 (previously, it was 50-100).</li>

<li>Removed 'ui_zoom' and 'tia_zoom' options, replacing them with
    'tia_filter' (which can be zoom1x, zoom2x, etc).  There is no equivalent
    for ui_zoom, since the UI can no longer be scaled.</li>

<li>Added experimental 64-bit version for Vista64 (may also work on WinXP64).
    This hasn't been extensively tested, and is probably quite a bit slower
    than the 32-bit version.</li>

<li>OSX port now requires at least 10.3 and XCode 3.0 to compile.  Sorry,
    but I no longer have access to older systems to compile for 10.2.</li>

<li>Huge updates to the documentation, particularly concerning the debugger.
    Many features that have been in Stella for a while are now documented for
    the first time.</li>
	</ul>


<H4>May 23, 2008</H4>
Stella release 2.6.1 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
	<ul>
<li>Introduced more accurate timing for NTSC vs. PAL modes, where the
    framerate is based on the number of scanlines per frame.  This should
    eliminate 'clicking' sounds when emulating ROMs that don't follow
    the exact NTSC or PAL scanline specs.</li>

<li>Added ability to see the current number of scanlines and corresponding
    framerate to the TIA emulation.  This can be set with the '-stats'
    commandline argument, or dynamically turned on and off with the
    'Alt-l' key combo.</li>

<li>Modified '-framerate' commandline argument, where a non-zero value
    overrides the automatic framerate calculation (based on number of
    scanlines).  Setting 'framerate' to zero re-enables auto-frame
    calculation.  Also, re-enabled changing the framerate from within the
    UI.</li>

<li>Added '-timing' commandline argument, which sets the type of waiting
    between processing frames.  Setting it to 'sleep' emulates the
    previous behaviour in Stella; setting it to 'busy' emulates z26,
    and can in some cases eliminate screen tearing (at the expense of
    using all available CPU time).</li>

<li>Fixed issue with debugger disassembly and mirrored $40 TIA write
    addresses.  They were actually defined at $30, and generating incorrect
    labels.</li>

<li>Fixed issue in AtariVox and SaveKey controllers where accessing the
    EEPROM sometimes failed after the first write.</li>

<li>Changed AtariVox and SaveKey EEPROM emulation to default to $FF for
    a blank EEPROM.</li>

<li>Fixed regression in cart auto-detection logic; some F6 ROMs were being
    misdetected as E7.</li>

<li>Fixed issue with M6532/RIOT timer initialization; it was causing some
    ROMs to hang (most notably Summer Games).  Related to this, reworked
    the built-in random number generator to generate 'more random' numbers.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in CommandMenu where console buttons (Select, Reset, etc)
    weren't doing anything.</li>
	</ul>


<H4>May 16, 2008</H4>
Stella release 2.6 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
<ul>
    <li>Added AtariVox support using a real AtariVox device, where Stella
    sends data directly to the AtariVox.  For now, this is supported in
    Linux/UNIX, OSX, and Win32 only.  You'll obviously need a real
    AtariVox, and a serial<->USB adaptor to connect it to your system.
    Added '-avoxport' commandline argument used to set the serial port
    to which the AtariVox is connected.  Special thanks to Al Yarusso
    and Richard H. for providing sample hardware.</li>

    <li>Added AtariVox and SaveKey EEPROM emulation.  This reads/writes data
    to a 32KB file, not to the actual hardware.  Very useful for testing
    EEPROM support without actually wearing out the real device.  Special
    thanks to J. Payson for providing the EEPROM emulation code, and A.
    Herbert for answering many driver-related questions.</li>

    <li>Added support for CX-22, CX-80, and AmigaMouse trackball controllers.</li>

    <li>Improved debugger symfile handling so that addresses accessed as
    read-only won't use write-only labels (and vice-versa).  More work
    is still needed in this area.</li>

    <li>Added M6532/RIOT tab to the debugger.  This will be expanded on in a
    future release.</li>

    <li>Added TIA emulation fixes for graphical glitches in Escape from the
    Mindmaster, Mission Survive, Solaris, and SWOOPS!</li>

    <li>Fixed bug where fullscreen OpenGL scaling wasn't working on 4:3 monitors.</li>

    <li>Further improvements to the M6532/RIOT emulation, which unfortunately
    have broken old state files (again).</li>

    <li>Added deadzone setting, for adjusting the deadzone amount for
    analog joysticks.  This can be set using the commandline argument
    '-joydeadzone' or dynamically within the UI.</li>

    <li>Make ROM disassembly in debugger take advantage of a wide window.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug in 6507 BCD handling introduced in the last release.</li>

    <li>For the Win32 port; Win9x should be fully supported again.</li>
</ul>


<H4>April 9, 2008</H4>
Stella release 2.5.1 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
<ul>
<li>Fixed M6532 RIOT timer emulation.  More testing is needed, but the
    changes so far have fixed several ROMs that didn't work before.</li>

<li>Fixed issue with weird characters in the debugger disassembly when
    loading .lst files.</li>

<li>Fixed bug where entering the debugger for 4A50 and E0 carts caused
    the ROM to be frozen afterwords.</li>

<li>Removed logic whereby starting a ROM from something other than the
    built-in launcher wouldn't allow the user to go back to the ROM launcher.</li>

<li>Fixed bug (hopefully) with the app icon not showing on the Stella window.
    Further testing is needed, since I can't duplicate the error myself.</li>

<li>Fixed default snapshot folder issues; the folder will now be
    automatically created in the same place as state folders, ini files,
    etc (whereever that may be for your platform).</li>

<li>Re-added 'lastrom' functionality, where Stella will remember and
    auto-select the last ROM that was successfully launched in the ROM
    launcher.</li>

<li>For Stella developers, fixed SpeakJet emulation so it compiles again.
    No improvements have been made to the emulation itself, though.</li>
</ul>


<H4>March 28, 2008</H4>
Stella release 2.5 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.

<ul>
<li>Added RomInfo widget to the ROM launcher, which shows properties
    information and a snapshot of the currently selected ROM.  Updated the UI
    and added '-romviewer' commandline argument to activate this setting.
    Note that the ROM launcher will have to be sized at least 640x480 for this
    to be used.  Also note that the snapshots must be in 1x mode with a
    maximum size of 320x260.  This will be expanded on in a future release.</li>

<li>Added ROM audit functionality, whereby ROMs can be physically renamed
    according to their properties' name.</li>

<li>Added bankswitching support for 0840, SB, X07 and 4A50.  A special thanks
    to Eckhard Stolberg for much help in this area.</li>

<li>Removed "non-browse" functionality from the ROM launcher; it now always
    uses browse/filesystem mode.  The previous 'pretty' names can now be
    seen by renaming all your ROMs with the new ROM audit feature.</li>

<li>Huge overhaul of controller handling and Stelladaptor support, making it
    much easier to add new controller types in a future release.</li>

<li>Fixed paddle issues in Night Driver; paddle emulation speed should be
    much better.</li>

<li>Fixed several 6507 emulation bugs related to BCD handling.</li>

<li>Updated ROM properties based on info from RomHunter.</li>

<li>ROM properties can now be edited from the ROM launcher; you no longer
    have to start a ROM to do so.</li>

<li>Added support for configurable font to ROM launcher (currently only
    'small' and 'large').  Updated the UI and added -launcherfont' commandline
    argument to change this setting.</li>

<li>Added SECAM, NTSC50, PAL60 and SECAM60 to the list of formats that can
    be used.  Also, switching between these modes with 'Ctrl-f' now switches
    the palette only; the number of scanlines won't change.</li>

<li>Fixed crash when switching between software and OpenGL mode with a
    Stelladaptor plugged in.</li>

<li>Added '-tiafloat' commandline argument, which determines whether or not
    the TIA pins are in a 'floating' state.  This is useful for testing on
    certain CMOS EPROM chips where the unused TIA pins on a read are not
    floating but pulled high.</li>

<li>Fixed issue in debugger where once a .sym file was loaded, it was used
    in all ROMs loaded after that.</li>

<li>Fixed issue in debugger where equate names weren't showing up in the RAM
    and CPU widgets.  Note that this still isn't perfect, and needs support
    from DASM for proper functionality.</li>

<li>Updated state file format, creating smaller files (and in preparation
    for state rewinding in a future release).  Old state saves will no longer
    work.</li>

<li>Added '-bs' commandline argument, which is an alias for '-type' (which
    is still present).</li>

<li>Removed -pXspeed' commandline arguments, and replaced them with a
    single '-pspeed'.</li>

<li>Removed '-paddle' commandline argument.  The paddle currently emulated
    by the mouse can still be changed with Ctrl-0..3 or within the UI, but
    the setting is no longer saved.</li>

<li>Reworked UI for specifying that the console ports have been swapped,
    hopefully making it easier to understand.</li>

<li>Added 'Ctrl-c' & 'Ctrl-v' to EditTextWidgets, allowing to copy and paste
    the text widget contents.  More work in this area is coming in a future
    release.</li>

<li>Added 'Ctrl-leftarrow' and 'Ctrl-rightarrow' to EditTextWidgets, to move
    to the first character of previous and next words (respectively).</li>

<li>For the Win32 port: fixed OpenGL crashes in Vista.  Graphical updates
    are still slower in Vista compared to XP, though.</li>

<li>For the Win32 port: default folder for Stella config files is now
    'My Documents\Stella'; this can be disabled if necessary.  This should
    fix issues with losing settings when launching Stella from an IDE,
    and the creation of stella.ini and 'state' directories in many
    different places.</li>

<li>For the Win32 port: several fixes to the Visual Studio project files,
    allowing building in debug or release mode, for both i386 and x86_64.
    The project files have been upgraded to Visual Studio 2008, and Stella
    can now be built and distributed without the VS runtime libraries.</li>

<li>Updated configure script for cross-compiling Win32 version in Linux.</li>
</ul>


<H4>September 18, 2007</H4>
Stella release 2.4.2 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.

<ul>
<li>Made usage of 'GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB' extension configurable, and
	have it default to off.  This should take care of the black/white
	screen many people were experiencing with ATI video hardware.  This
	is accessible using the 'gl_texrect' commandline argument).  Set it to
	'true' or 'false' to enable/disable the extension.</li>
</ul>


<H4>August 27, 2007</H4>
Stella release 2.4.1 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

<ul>
<li>Re-added OpenGL aspect ratio setting ('gl_aspect' commandline argument).</li>

<li>Re-added non-browser mode to the ROM launcher.</li>

<li>For the Linux/UNIX port; fixed OpenGL vsync issue with Nvidia video cards.</li>
</ul>


<H4>August 20, 2007</H4>
Stella release 2.4 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

	<ul>
<li>Added new video sub-system where fullscreen and windowed modes are treated
    differently.  Windowed modes now use '-zoom_tia' and '-zoom_ui' arguments,
    while fullscreen modes can be specified by resolution using the new
    '-fullres' argument.</li>

<li>Widescreen video modes are now supported; Stella will simply center the
    image with surrounding black borders.</li>

<li>Many UI-related changes, including resizable ROM launcher and debugger
    windows, and a new UI palette (the previous 'classic' palette is still
    available).  This is still a work in progress.</li>

<li>The locations of all major config files (statedir, palette file,
    cheat file, properties file, etc) are now configurable from the
    commandline and within the UI.</li>

<li>Updates to TIA palette support.  Added SECAM support, and removed the
    built-in 'original' palette.  Standard, z26, and user are still
    available.</li>

<li>Various bugfixes to some debugger commands.  The 'run' command no
    longer causes a crash, and several others have better error-checking.</li>

<li>Added more complete cartridge auto-detection for Commavid (CV), 3E,
    3F and Activision (FE) formats.</li>

<li>Removed XStart and Width ROM properties, since the forthcoming TIA
    rework won't be using them.</li>

<li>Reworked internal storage of ROM properties to be faster and take up
    less space.</li>

<li>Added several different ways of stretching the OpenGL image to the
    '-gl_fsmax' argument, for more flexibility.</li>

<li>Removed OpenGL aspect ratio setting favour of the previously mentioned
    video changes.  We'll see how this goes.</li>

<li>Removed dirty-rect support from software rendering, since it was actually
    sub-optimal in Windows and OSX and defaulted to off in previous versions.</li>

<li>Added support for gzipped ROMs.</li>

<li>Re-added pause support.</li>

<li>Re-added support for Windows 98.</li>

<li>Removed support for 'STELLA_BASEDIR' environment variable, since each
    config file can be now configured separately.</li>

<li>Removed '-fastscbios' argument, since it must always be turned on.</li>

<li>Removed PSP support, since it hasn't been updated in over a year, and
    someone else is maintaining another port elsewhere.</li>

<li>For the Unix/Linux port; fixed 'make install' issues, and changed icon to
    PNG format.</li>
	</ul>


<H4>January 17, 2007</H4>
Stella release 2.3.5 for Linux, Mac OSX, Windows and GP2X is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

	<ul>
<li>Greatly improved cartridge bankswitch type auto-detection.  Stella
can now (mostly) autodetect cartridge types 'E0', 'E7', '3E', '3F' and
Superchip carts.  Obviously, this autodetection is not infallible, but
relies on patterns in the ROM data, and how it was compiled.  Because
of the auto-detection types already supported, almost all bankswitch
info was removed from internal ROM properties.  Set the ROM property
"Cartridge.Type" to "Auto-detect" for this to take effect.</li>

<li>Added auto-detection of display type (NTSC or PAL).  Currently, PAL60
ROMs will be detected as NTSC.  This is almost 100% accurate, and fails
in very few cases (for those that are mislabeled, the ROM properties
can be set specifically).  Set the ROM property "Display.Format" to
"Auto-detect" for this to take effect.</li>

<li>Improved emulation timing when exiting one ROM and starting another.
Previously, this could result in the second ROM having its sound start
later than it should have.</li>

<li>Removed pause functionality from the core, since it's been superceded
by the other event states.  You can now enter one of the menus for a
similar effect (options, command, debugger, etc).</li>

<li>Added toggle for PAL color-loss emulation, which defaults to off.
Previous versions of Stella always used color-loss emulation.
Related to this, added 'colorloss' commandline argument.</li>

<li>Added rudimentary support for configuring the UI palette ('uipalette'
commandline argument) and ability to change the size of the launcher window
('launchersize' commandline argument).  This will be expanded on in future
releases.</li>

<li>Reworked options menu so it's now accessible from the ROM launcher as
well as while playing a ROM.</li>

<li>Re-added ability to change the width and height of a Console.  Related to
this, changing XStart/YStart/Width/Height dynamically no longer resets
the ROM.</li>

<li>Removed 'tiadefaults' commandline argument, since Stella will now default
to using accurate positioning, and not use 'tweaks'.</li>

<li>Joystick code now allows all 4 directions; 'Bumper Bash' now works
correctly.</li>

<li>Improved Keypad emulation; 'Alpha Beam with Ernie', 'Oscars Trash Race'
and 'Magicard' now work correctly.</li>

<li>Reworked GUI code, so that all dialog boxes are automatically centered.</li>

<li>Added 'rominfo' commandline argument, which prints some detailed info for
a ROM.</li>

<li>For the OSX port; fixed crashes in OpenGL mode.</li>

<li>For the GP2X port; some improvements to the sound code.</li>

<li>For the GP2X port; added vertical centering of the TIA image (when possible).</li>
	</ul>


<H4>December 22, 2006</H4>
Stella release 2.3 for Linux, Mac OSX, Windows and GP2X is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

	<ul>
<li><b>Note: Because of the many changes in this release, all settings
will be reset to defaults.  If this doesn't happen for you, it will be necessary
to manually delete your previous settings (see 'Settings' section of the manual
for more information).</b></li>

<li>Potentially huge speedups in software rendering mode, both in emulation
and UI modes.  Deactivating 'dirty rects' uses these new modes, which
can be 2-3 times faster for many configurations.</li>

<li>For UI navigation, changed from using 'joymouse' to the more familiar
'tabbing' functionality, where you move from object to object by use of
some tab key.  As a result, completely removed the 'joymouse' commandline
argument and all associated functionality.</li>

<li>Added event remapping for UI events, separate from events while in emulation
mode.</li>

<li>Added support for PAL60 ROMs, which use the PAL palette and resolution
but run at NTSC timing (60Hz).  Added ROM property for this, and updated
the internal properties database for many PAL60 ROMs.</li>

<li>Added support for user-definable palettes.  For now, only one extra palette
is supported, but in the future we may have them specified per-ROM.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in PAL colour-loss emulation, which wasn't actually being done
for the original Stella and z26 palettes.</li>

<li>Fixed several TIA-related emulation bugs as reported on AtariAge.  More
fixes will come with the TIA rewrite, due in the next release.</li>

<li>Added new scaler infrastructure, replacing the '-zoom' commandline argument
with '-scale_ui' and '-scale_tia'.  This means the UI and emulation can now
be scaled independently.</li>

<li>Added '-gl_vsync' commandline argument and associated UI elements, which
uses synchronization to vertical blank interrupt in OpenGL on supported
systems.  This eliminates tearing in OpenGL rendering.</li>

<li>Changed naming of snapshots and state files.  These files are now
named based on the names given in the properties database, and no longer
use the 'md5sum' name.  As a result, state files from previous versions
will no longer work unless they're manually renamed.  Related to this,
removed the '-ssname' commandline argument.</li>

<li>Fixed bug where 'Snapshot saved' appeared when taking snapshots in
succession.</li>

<li>Added a 'Previous directory' entry to the top of each listing while
in ROM Browse mode, which is equivalent to the 'Go Up' button.  This makes
it easier to navigate the filesystem, since you never have to 'tab out'
of the ROM listing.</li>

<li>Added all sound related commandline options to the UI, so you no
longer have to use the commandline to set those options.</li>

<li>Added new property to ROM properties specifying whether to swap paddles
plugged into a virtual port.  This eliminates the need to manually set the
paddle mode for those ROMs that don't use paddle zero by default.</li>

<li>Added a 'Defaults' button to the Game Properties dialog, which resets
the ROM properties to the internal defaults, deleting that ROMs properties
from the external properties file.</li>

<li>Fixed bug whereby modified ROM properties weren't being reloaded when
restarting a ROM.</li>

<li>Made 'phosphor' and 'phosphor blend' a ROM property, meaning it can be
set per-ROM.</li>

<li>Added support for relocating the base Stella directory, by setting the
environment variable 'STELLA_BASEDIR'.  This must be done each time before
Stella starts.</li>

<li>Added '-fastscbios' commandline argument, which speeds up loading of 
vertical bars in Supercharger ROMs, and made it the default.</li>

<li>Added '-autoslot' commandline argument, which automatically switches
to the next available slot after saving a state.  This defaults to off,
and must be set from the commandline.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in debugger command 'runto', which could enter an infinite
loop under some conditions.</li>

<li>Updated configure/build toolchain so patching is no longer required for Debian
packages.</li>

<li>Removed dependency on PNG library (PNG snapshots are still present, but the
actual library is no longer required).</li>

<li>For the OSX port, improved OpenGL performance on Mac Mini using Intel GMA950
video hardware.</li>

<li>For the GP2X port, added support for PAL ROMs, and updated SDL to use hardware
scaling.</li>

	</ul>


<H4>April 7, 2006</H4>
Stella release 2.2 for Linux, Mac OSX, Windows, WinCE and GP2X is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

	<ul>
<li>Added new ROM browser option which works like a normal filesystem
    browser, allowing navigation throughout the filesystem.
    The old mode of browsing is still present, and can be toggled at
    runtime.  Related to this, fixed bug whereby sorting in the ROM
    launcher sometimes didn't work.</li>

<li>Integrated stella.pro properties into the application, resulting in
    faster startup time.  Now Stella can be redistributed as a single
    binary; no external files are needed, but they will still be used
    if present.</li>

<li>Reworked ROM properties files once again.  The 'user.pro' file has
    been removed, and all user-defined properties are stored in
    'stella.pro' instead.  You should delete all properties files when
    upgrading to this version, to take advantage of the speed increases.</li>

<li>Reworked settings files once again.  Removed all references to a
    global settings file.  Each user now gets a user-specific settings
    file only.  If that file doesn't exist, the built-in defaults are
    used.</li>

<li>Added 'conditional saving' of the cheatcode and settings files, so
    that these files are only written to disk when absolutely
    necessary.  This doesn't really affect desktop systems, but is very
    useful for systems with flashram-based storage (GP2X, WinCE, etc).</li>

<li>Reworked Settings class, hopefully fixing a bug whereby settings
    weren't being saved in certain cases (most evident in the OSX port).</li>

<li>Added 'tiadefaults' commandline option, which can also be toggled
    from within the GUI.  This option disables all TIA positioning
    'tweaks' that typically make a game look better, and present the
    image exactly as it would appear on a real 2600.</li>

<li>Added jitter-detection code for the paddle emulation, which should
    eliminate an annoying 'jittering' effect when using paddles with
    a Stelladaptor.</li>

<li>Related to jitter-detection, added '-pthresh' commandline option
    and GUI entry, which sets a bound below which the emulation detects
    jitter.</li>

<li>Fixed crash when adding one-shot cheats.</li>

<li>Fixed bug in RAM comparitive searches in the debugger.</li>

<li>Fixed bug with setting snapshot naming type from the GUI (it was
    always being set to 'romname').</li>

<li>Re-added low compatibility CPU emulation mode, since it benefits
    some slower systems.  This is activated with the commandline argument
    '-cpu low'.</li>

<li>For the OSX port, added Universal binary support.</li>

<li>For the OSX port, reworked the menu handling, so that certain menu
    options are only enabled when it makes sense to do so.</li>

<li>For the GP2X port, fixed joystick deadzone issues and scroll bug in
    ROM launcher.</li>

<li>For the GP2X port, fixed issue with PAL ROMs causing a crash because of
    screen size.  A message is now shown indicating that PAL ROMs are not
    yet supported.</li>
	</ul>


<H4>January 29, 2006</H4>
Stella release 2.1 for Linux, Mac OSX, Windows, WinCE and GP2X is now available.
Ports to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

	<ul>
		<li>Added <b>phosphor effect</b>, similar to z26.  Useful on ROMs which
			alternate sprites from one frame to another, resulting in an
			annoying flicker.  When using phosphor mode, a pixels colour is mixed
			with its previous value, resulting in a blended image that doesn't
			flicker, emulating the phosphoresence effect on a real television.</li>

		<li>Added 'pp' developer commandline argument to set the "Display.Phosphor"
			property, and 'ppblend' to set the amount to blend pixels in
			phosphor mode.  Also added 'Alt p' key to enable/disable phosphor
			effect while ROM is emulated.  By default, phosphor mode is only used
			when necessary, as specified in the stella.pro file.</li>

		<li>Renamed 'cheetah' commandline argument to 'cheat'.</li>

		<li>Added per-frame cheatcodes (4 characters long), which are evaluated
			each frame.</li>

		<li>Added cheatcode GUI, where cheats can be named, edited, saved, etc.</li>

		<li>Cheat codes are now saved to stella.cht file and are automatically
			reloaded when Stella starts.</li>

		<li>Improved 'joymouse' functionality.  While in GUI mode, any axis
			will simulate mouse movement, and any button will simulate a mouse
			click.  So the GUI can be completely navigated without a mouse.</li>

		<li>Improved CommandDialog and LauncherDialog wrt joymouse functionality.
			These dialogs are used more than any other on devices without a mouse,
			so joystick axis movement switches between GUI objects, rather than
			simulating the mouse.  This leads to much faster selection of objects.</li>

		<li>Added mapping of multiple SDL joystick axis to Event Mapping.</li>

		<li>Added joystick hat support, and mapping of multiple hats to Event
			Mapping.</li>

		<li>Added remapping of paddle emulation to the keyboard or joystick axis
			(the mouse is still used by default for paddles).  Related to this,
			use more precise analog values when analog axis are mapped to
			analog-type events (such as paddles).</li>

		<li>Treat joystick events as other types of controllers based on the
			virtual port entry in stella.pro.  This means that mappings for a
			joystick will emulate other devices when necessary.</li>

		<li>Added 'sp' developer commandline argument, which sets the 
			"Console.SwapPorts" property and swaps the arrangement of the
			virtual ports.  Useful for games like "Raiders of the Lost Ark",
			where the joysticks are normally swapped.</li>

		<li>Added ability to set which Stelladaptor device emulates which virtual
			joystick port ('sa1' and 'sa2' commandline arguments, which accept
			'left' or 'right').</li>

		<li>Fixed issues with jittering joysticks/mice causing weird events when
			starting Stella.</li>

		<li>Added 'freq', 'tiafreq' and 'clipvol' commandline arguments, which
			affect the sound subsystem (see manual for further info).</li>

		<li>Made state files completely cross-platform, both in terms of endianness
			as well as CPU size (32 vs. 64 bit).</li>

		<li>Fixed crash with using 'cheat' and 'break' from the commandline.</li>

		<li>Implemented dynamic loading of OpenGL library.</li>
	</ul>


<H4>October 25, 2005</H4>
Stella release 2.0.1 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available. Ports
to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

	<ul>
		<li>Added 'dirtyrects' support, which speeds up rendering for some Windows
			users.</li>

		<li>Fixed bug where taking snapshots would fail if the snapshot directory
			wasn't specified.</li>

		<li>Made ROM launcher case-insensitive, so upper and lowercase names are now
			mixed in the correct order.</li>

		<li>Fixed ZIP ROM support to search the archive for ROMs ending with either
			.bin or .a26 (case insensitive).</li>

		<li>ROMs which don't have an associated properties entry are no longer named
			'Untitled' in the Stella window or when taking snapshots.  The actual
			ROM name is now used.</li>

		<li>Changed minimum height of debugger to be 27 lines in the prompt, or approx.
			700 pixels high.  This should make using the debugger easier for users
			with lower resolution monitors.  Related to this, the RomWidget now uses
			all possible vertical space when changing the debugger height.</li>

		<li>Fixed bug related to upgrading Stella and event mappings being incorrect.
			Stella now detects this, and uses the default mappings.  So upgrading
			to version 2.0.1 means your event mappings will be reset.</li>

		<li>Fixed bug in loading debugger symbol files generated on different
			operating systems.</li>

		<li>For the Windows port; added exe installer based on InnoSetup.</li>

		<li>For the Windows port; compiled icon into Stella, so it now looks like
			a real Win32 application.</li>

		<li>For the OSX port, reverted window resize key combos back to 'Cmd =' and
			'Cmd -' to match the 1.4.2 release.</li>
	</ul>

<H4>October 16, 2005</H4>
Stella release 2.0 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available. Ports
to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

	<ul>
		<li>Added integrated GUI.  Stella is now a fully graphical application, and all
			settings can be changed dynamically while the application is running.  That
			means the commandline is no longer required (but support is still there
			for those who want to use it).</li>

		<li>Added ROM launcher.  You can now exit a game and start playing another one
			from directly within Stella (you no longer have to quit Stella and
			restart it).</li>

		<li>Because of the integrated GUI and ROM launcher, StellaX and KStella
			(the Windows and Linux frontends) have been discontinued.  The OSX
			port now uses the launcher as well.</li>

		<li>Added an integrated debugger for game developers.  This is currently
			the first version of a debugger in Stella, but it's already quite
			usable.</li>

		<li>Added new sound subsystem, which is much faster and more accurate.  Related
			to this, added stereo sound output (used by some homebrew games).

		<li>Added ZIP support.  Stella can now open ROM's compressed in zip
			format.</li>

		<li>Added cartridge 'frying', thanks to Fred "batari" Quimby.  This
			emulates the action of turning the power button on and off on a
			real Atari, often resulting in some strange effects.</li>

		<li>Added ability to edit current ROM properties from directly within
			Stella, which can then be saved directly into the 'user.pro' file.
			So creating a properties entry for a new ROM can be done without
			any external tools.</li>

		<li>Added initial support for using Stella in an 'arcade-box'
			environment without a keyboard.  This consists of an in-game
			menu for choosing common actions in Stella, as well as using the
			joystick navigate the mouse pointer.</li>

		<li>Reworked properties system to use both a system-wide 'stella.pro' and
			a per-user 'user.pro' properties files.  Changes made by the user
			and stored in 'user.pro' are no longer erased when upgrading Stella.</li>

		<li>Added support for cartridges with 3E bankswitching format.</li>

		<li>Added preliminary Cheat support.</li>

		<li>Added <b>Alt/Shift-Cmd z, x, c, v, b, n</b> keys to enable/disable the
			P0, P1, M0, M1, BL, PL bits in the TIA, respectively.</li> 

		<li>Added <b>Alt/Shift-Cmd .</b> key to disable all bits in the TIA.</li>
 
		<li>Added <b>Alt/Shift-Cmd /</b> key to enable all bits in the TIA.</li>

		<li>Added <b>Alt/Shift-Cmd g</b> key to switch dynamically switch between
			software and OpenGL modes while Stella is running.</li>

		<li>Added <b>Ctrl/Cmd r</b> key to reload the ROM currently being
			emulated.</li>

		<li>Added <b>Alt/Shift-Cmd s</b> key to merge the current game properties
			into the properties file.</li>

		<li>Added <b>help</b> commandline argument.  Launching Stella from the
			commandline with no options now starts Stella in ROM launcher mode,
			instead of showing help (as in previous versions).</li>

		<li>Added the following commandline arguments for developers:
			<b>pro, type, ld, rd, tv, lc, rc, bc, format, xstart, ystart, width
			height, cpu, hmove</b>.  Developers can consult the manual for
			further details.</li>

		<li>Removed <b>mergeprops</b> commandline argument, since there are now
				dedicated keys to either save or merge game properties.</li>

		<li>Removed <b>hidecursor</b> commandline argument.  Stella will now
			automatically decide when to use this setting.</li>

		<li>Fixed framerate when switching between NTSC and PAL modes.  Stella
			now uses the correct framerate based on the format of the ROM,
			in terms of both video <b>and</b> audio.</li>

		<li>Added 'configure' support to the build process for both Linux and
			Win32 (using MinGW).  Developers can now use the familiar 'configure;
			make; make install' commands to compile Stella.</li>

		<li>Further consolidation and integration of SDL.  This should lead to
			faster operation and a more consistent look for all ports.</li>

		<li>Fixed some 64-bit issues.  Stella now compiles and runs correctly
			on AMD64 and PPC64 Linux systems.</li>

		<li>Updated the Stella manual with pictures of the new integrated GUI.</li>
	</ul>

<H4>February 19, 2005</H4>
Stella release 1.4.2 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available. Ports
to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

	<ul>
		<li>Updated the sound system. All popping and cracking sounds that previously
		    occurred at program start/stop and when entering/exiting menu or pause
		    mode have been eliminated.</li>

		<li>Fixed the gl_fsmax argument to mean "switch to desktop resolution on
		    fullscreen OpenGL", instead of to the maximum possible resolution (the two
		    are not always the same).</li>

		<li>Added Alt [ and Alt ] keys to dynamically adjust the sound volume during
		    emulation.</li>

		<li>Added Control 0, Control 1, Control 2, Control 3 keys to dynamically change
		    which paddle the mouse should emulate.</li>

		<li>Added video_driver argument. This accepts the different options that can be
		    specified for SDL_VIDEODRIVER (see SDL homepage for more information).
		    Basically, it eliminates the need to set the SDL_VIDEODRIVER environment
		    variable.</li>

		<li>Made sure screen is refreshed before taking a snapshot.  This eliminates
		    the problem with new snapshots containing the text "Snapshot saved".</li>

		<li>For the Windows port; added windib and directx as options for
		    'video_driver' when using software rendering. The 'windib' option is now
		    the default, and in many cases it's up to 10 times faster than using
		    'directx'.</li>

		<li>For the OSX port; added 'Cmd-R' key to reload the currently loaded ROM.</li>
	</ul>

<H4>August 15, 2004</H4>
Stella release 1.4.1 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available. Ports
to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

	<ul>
		<li>Fixed PAL sound issues.  PAL games now should sound correct (no distortion
			or missing sounds), but some games may still run too fast.  This is still
			a work-in-progress, and will be fixed in Stella 1.5.</li>

		<li>Cleaned up the SDL event gathering loop.  This should hopefully fix the
			problems with "double-pumping events" reported by some Windows users.
			Event gathering and dispatching is now much faster as well.</li>

		<li>Fixed a bug where the Control or Alt keys could be assigned to some event,
			but they could never be used.  Control/Alt can now be used for any event.</li>

		<li>Updated stella.pro file to work with the latest Good2600 ROMset release
			(Thanks go to Voch for helping to maintain the stella.pro file).</li>

		<li>For the Windows port; removed requirement for ROM files to be named *.bin
		in the StellaX frontend.  The ROM's can now have any name, but ZIP-files are
		not yet supported.</li>

		<li>For the Windows port; fixed the problems with the included modified SDL
			library and Windows 98 users.  Stella should now run in Windows 98.</li>

		<li>For the OSX port; added preference to allow user to select the directory
			in which ROM images are stored.  This sets the default directory to start
			the browsing for a ROM in, and doesn't preclude the user from selecting a 
			file outside that directory.</li>

		<li>For the OSX port; fixed preferences bug where Preferences changed before
			a game was opened were not being saved.</li>
	</ul>

<H4>July 17, 2004</H4>
Stella release 1.4 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows is now available. Ports
to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

	<ul>
		<li>Codebase ported to SDL.  The DOS and X11 ports have been discontinued.</li>
		<li>Sound code ported to SDL.  For the Linux versions, ALSA and OSS sound
			support has been discontinued.</li>
		<li>The Linux, MacOSX and Windows ports are now based on the same codebase and
			are actively maintained.  That means simultaneous (and hopefully
			more frequent) releases.</li>
		<li>A new Windows port has been created, with the GUI based on StellaX.
			This is the first new release for Windows since Stella 1.2.
			(software  mode is not yet optimized; OpenGL mode works much better)</li>
		<li>A new Mac OSX port has been created by Mark Grebe.  This is the first new
			release for Mac OSX	since Stella 1.2.</li>
		<li>Added OpenGL rendering support.</li>
		<li>Added more refined in-game GUI.</li>
		<li>Added event remapping.  Emulation keys can now be remapped to the keyboard
			or up to 4 joysticks.</li>
		<li>Added native Stelladaptor support.  Joysticks, paddles, and driving controllers
			have been tested.</li>
		<li>Digital sound support (used in games like Quadrun and Pitfall2) has been
			greatly improved.  Sound generation is now more tightly synchronized with
			video updates.</li>
		<li>Added support for switchable palettes.  Currently you can switch between the
			current Stella palette, original Stella palette (pre-1.2 versions), and
			the z26 palette.</li>
		<li>Added support for UA Limited style bankswitching (Funky Fish and Pleiades).</li>
		<li>Switched to using <i>high compatibility M6502 mode</i> by default. This
			means old state saves from previous Stella versions will no longer work.</li>
		<li>The meaning of the "<i>-sound</i>" command line option has been changed.
			This option now accepts either 'true' or 'false (1 or 0) to enable/disable
			sound.</li>
		<li>Changed sound mixer functionality.  The system volume/mixer settings will
			never be changed; volume changes in Stella will only affect the emulation
			itself.</li>
		<li>Added "<i>-video</i>" command line option.  This option accepts either 'soft'
			or 'gl', to use software/OpenGL rendering.</li>
		<li>Added "<i>-gl_filter</i>" command line option.  This option accepts either
			'nearest' or 'linear', to use GL_NEAREST or GL_LINEAR filtering.</li>
		<li>Added "<i>-gl_aspect</i>" command line option.  This option accepts a decimal
			value specifying how much to scale the width of the emulation image (useful
			for giving an authentic 'square-looking' 4:3 mode).</li>
		<li>Added "<i>-gl_fsmax</i>" command line option.  This option accepts either
			'true' or 'false, and specifies to use the maximum possible resolution when
			in fullscreen OpenGL mode (useful for Linux and for Windows on laptops).</li>
		<li>Added "<i>-fragsize</i>" command line option.  This option accepts the
			size to use for sound fragments.  Linux/MacOSX works well with 512,
			Windows seems to need 2048.  This value must be a power of two.</li>
		<li>Modified "<i>-volume</i>" command line option.  If you specify '-1',
			Stella will use the system volume.</li>
		<li>Renamed the "<i>-pro</i>" command line option to "<i>-altpro</i>".</li>
		<li>Renamed the "<i>-fps</i>" command line option to "<i>-framerate</i>".</li>
		<li>Removed the "<i>-center</i>" command line option.  Stella now automatically
			centers the window when possible.</li>
		<li>Removed the "<i>-paddle real</i>" command line option, since it never really
			worked correctly (and Stelladaptor support adds that functionality
			anyway).</li>
		<li>Removed all command line options relating to the X11 port
			(owncmap, display).</li>
	</ul>

<H4>February 17, 2003</H4>
Stella release 1.3 for DOS, Linux, and Unix is now available. Ports
to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:

<UL>
<LI>Improved TIA sound system so that games with digitized audio work

<LI>Added saving and loading of game state to the core; X11, SDL, and DOS
    versions current support saving and loading game state

<LI>Added support for F4 bankswitching method

<LI>Pitfall II DPC sound emulation completed

<LI>Fixed a bug which caused the difficulty switches to operate backwards

<LI>Changed DPC auto-detection to use file size so that Pitfall II mods work

<LI>Modified RIOT timer emulation so that startup values are random

<LI>Added 3F bankswitching auto-detection routine so that homebrews and
    demos work without a stella.pro entry

<LI>Updated the TIA message boxes so they look a little nicer 

<LI>Latest stella.pro file included in distribution

<LI>Added some developer options to the core, and the ability to change game
    width, height, xstart, ystart, and others while the emulation is running.
    Added ability to switch between NTSC and PAL at runtime, and the ability
    to save the current properties to a file or to merge the changes into the
    stella.pro file; X11 and SDL versions supported for now (compile option)

<LI>External sound server for the X11 and SDL versions no longer required, as
    all sound code is now integrated into the core 

<LI>Changed locations of the user's config files for the X11 and SDL versions;
    the user's stellarc file is now located in $HOME/.stella/stellarc, state
    files are located in $HOME/.stella/state/ and the stella.pro file is
    located in $HOME/.stella/stella.pro

<LI>Changed the way options are supplied on the commandline for the X11 and
    SDL versions. Now all commandline options take exactly the same arguments
    as in the INI file.

<LI>Added "-accurate" command line option to choose between accurate
    (CPU-intensive) timing or less accurate (CPU-friendly) timing to X11
    and SDL versions. This is the final version of what was considered
    experimental timing code in Stella 1.2.

<LI>Added "-sound" command line option to choose which sound backend to
    use (alsa, oss, sdl) with the X11 and SDL versions.

<LI>Added the developer command line options to the X11 and SDL versions,
    which are only activated in developer builds: -Dformat, -Dwidth,
    -Dheight, -Dxstart, -Dystart, -Dmerge 

<LI>Fixed window resize bug in the X11 port

<LI>Added "-nosound" command line option to the DOS port to disable audio

<LI>DOS port supports a "-vsync" option to synchronize emulation with the
    video blank of the video card

<LI>Changed VGA code in the DOS port to use a 60Hz 320x200 and a 60Hz
    320x240 graphics mode

<LI>DOS port has been updated to run better under Windows NT, 2000, and XP.
    There are still issues with the sound, however, it is usable.

<LI>DOS port is using a new Sound Blaster driver created by Matt Conte which
    supports auto-detection of sound cards.

<LI>DOS port supports a STELLA_HOME environment variable that defines 
    the location of config files.
 
<LI>In the DOS port the stella.pro file is searched for first in the
    current working director and then in the $STELLA_HOME directory

<LI>In the DOS port the ROM image is searched for first using the
    specified path, then in $STELLA_HOME/ROMS, and finally in $STELLA_HOME

Stella release 1.2 for DOS, Linux, and Unix is now available. Ports
to other operating systems will be released as they become available.
A partial list of features is:
<UL>
<LI>Improved illegal CPU instruction support. Thrust and Qb will now operate
    correctly.

<LI>Improved emulation of undefined TIA reads. The ball in Video Pinball
    finally bounces off of the paddles!

<LI>More accurate NTSC and PAL palettes. These palettes should be much more
    like the colors displayed on a real TV.

<LI>PAL color loss is now emulated. If a PAL game displays an odd number
    of scanlines then the next frame will be displayed in black & white.

<LI>TIA emulation improved to fix some problems with Pole Position,
    Fatal Run, Dolphin, Decathlon, Robot Tank, and Hole Hunter.

<LI>Support for Pitfall II has been added, however, the enhanced sound
    provided by the DPC chip found in the Pitfall II cartridge isn't
    currently emulated.

<LI>Support added for the Commavid (CV) bankswitching method.

<LI>Support added for the Megaboy cartridge.

<LI>Improved Supercharger emulation including a new BIOS that shows the
    vertical blue progress bars like the real thing.

<LI>Code for the emulation core has been updated to work with newer C++
    compilers compliant with the C++ standard.

<LI>Basic message support added to the TIA emulation. This allows a short
    message to overlay the TIA frame. Currently, it's used when switching
    color modes and difficulty settings.

<LI>The internal data structure for the stella.pro file was changed from
    a resizable array to a binary search tree. This results in quicker
    startup times.

<LI>An SDL port of Stella is available (requires SDL 1.2.0 or greater)

<LI>Added option to not load in the whole stella.pro file when starting
    Stella. This option is enabled on the X11, SDL, and DOS versions. Win32
    version is left alone since it's needed for loading multiple games from
    the UI. Saves on memory usage.

<LI>Added INI file option to the X11 and SDL versions. Options can be
    specified in this file instead of entering them on the commandline. Any
    options entered on the commandline override options in the INI file.
    File is called stellarc. For the X11 and SDL versions, it can be in
    either $HOME (as $HOME/.stellarc) or in /etc (as /etc/stellarc).  The
    one in $HOME has higher priority than the one in /etc.

<LI>Added snapshot support to the X11 and SDL versions. Pressing F12 saves
    the current screen in PNG format. Requires PNG library.

<LI>Removed stella.pro file from the binary, resulting in large space
    savings. The stella.pro file is no longer optional.  For the X11 and
    SDL versions, it can be in either $HOME (as $HOME/.stella.pro) or in
    /etc (as /etc/stella.pro). The one in $HOME has higher priority than
    the one in /etc. For DOS and Win32 versions, the stella.pro file must
    be in the same directory as the executable.

<LI>Added pause functionality to the core. Implemented in DOS, X11, and
    SDL versions for now.
