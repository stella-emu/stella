<p>The Atari 2600 Video Computer System (VCS), introduced in 1977, was
the most popular home video game system of the early 1980's.&nbsp; Now
you can enjoy all of your favorite Atari 2600 games on your PC thanks to
Stella!

<p>Stella is a multi-platform Atari 2600 VCS emulator released under the
GNU General Public License (GPL).  Stella was originally developed
for Linux by <a href="http://www.bradfordmott.com/">Bradford W.
Mott</a>, however, since its original release several people have joined the
development team to port Stella to other operating systems such as AcornOS,
AmigaOS, DOS, FreeBSD, IRIX, Linux, OS/2, MacOS, Unix, and
Windows.  The development team is working hard to perfect the emulator 
and we hope you enjoy our effort.

<p>On this site you'll find information about downloading, installing,
using, and enhancing Stella.&nbsp; You'll also find useful information
about the Atari 2600 and emulation.
